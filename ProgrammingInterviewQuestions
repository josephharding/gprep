1) You have a set of integers. The function needs to return one inteteger such that it does not already
exist in the set of numbers and is within the bounds of 0 and the highest number in the set. It does not
necessarily need to be in any order relative to the set. If such a number does not exist, return the
next highest possible number. The numbers in the set are guaranteed to be unique.

Examples
{3, 4, 0, 1} would return 2
{0, 3, 2} would return 1
{1, 2} would return 0
{2, 4, 6} should return 0, 1, 3, or 5
